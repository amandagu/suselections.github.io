									<p><h2>About This Site</h2>
                                        <strong>POLLING IS OPEN FROM  MARCH 12TH, 9AM TO MARCH 17, 5PM TO ALL FACULTY OF SCIENCE AND ARTS & SCIENCE STUDENTS AT <a href=https://ssmu.simplyvoting.com>ssmu.simplyvoting.com</a>.</strong>
                                        <br>Hi there! This site is NOT affiliated with the SUS, aha... jk... unless...? ;) 
										<br>
										<br>Really this project was born out my frustration of having to be on Facebook and not having a centralized collection of all the candidates' platforms and the position responsibilities and the unfairness of having the number of Facebook friends you have determining how many people see your campaign page and many other things.
                                        <br>You can find an overviews of all of the candidates by position, view one candidate's entire campaign, as well as position descriptions and schedules via the menu.
										<br>
										<br>I will try my best to keep this as up-to-date as possible (probably once a day if midterms doesn't murder me). Thanks for stopping by to learn about the SUS executive council, SSMU Representative, and Science Senator candidates for the 2020-2021 academic year. I hope you find it helpful!
                                        <br>-Amanda</p>

                                    <h3>Chief Returning Officer (CRO)</h3>
                                    <p>The CRO is a non-voting member of the organization and reports directly to executive council or President(s). The CRO is responsible for all aspects of elections and referenda, from establishing voting procedures to the ruling on election matters like infractions.<br>
									Our current CRO is Matthew McLaughlin and can be reached at <a href = "mailto: cro.sus@mail.mcgill.ca">cro.sus@mail.mcgill.ca</a>.

									<h2> Land Acknowledgement</h2>
									<p>
										I and all the candidates would like to acknowledge that this event takes place on the traditional territory of the Indigenous People, Kanien'keha:ka, the keepers of the Eastern Door of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The island known as Montreal is known as Tio’tia:ke in the language of the Kanien’kehá:ka, and has historically served as a meeting place for other Indigenous nations.  It is not enough to just acknowledge the keepers of this land and McGill’s status as a settler-colonial institution. As such, we should actively resist (neo)-colonialism in the many forms it takes, and in the diversity of forms that resistance can take.<br>
										<br>(I'm always frustrated by posturing, and so I wanted to link a charity that is doing really great work in Indigenous spaces: <a href=https://https://indspire.ca>Indspire</a>)<br>
										One of the many issues that Indigenous communities in Canada face is the lack of accessible higher education, compounded with its high cost. In 2014, it was estimated that fewer than 10% of Indigenous people between the ages of 25 and 64 have a post-secondary degree. <a href=https://https://indspire.ca>Indspire</a> is a national Indigenous registered charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people by providing bursaries, scholarships, mentoring, educator resources, and more. 90% of Indspire students graduate and their work has been highly rated for accountability, transparency, and cost-efficiency by Charity Intelligence Canada and Maclean's. Check them out!

									<h2> SUS' Mandate</h2>
                                    <p>The Science Undergraduate Society (SUS) represents all students in the Faculty of Science. With nine executives, one senator, three SSMU Reps, over 200 committee members, and hundreds of volunteers, the SUS is well-equipped to serve the 5000+ B.Sc. and B.A.Sc. students at McGill.</p>
                                    <p>Our mandate is two-fold. The Science Undergraduate Society aims to a) promote the welfare and interests of all its members, and b) provide activities and services to enhance the educational, cultural, environmental and social conditions of its members.</p>
                                    <p>In respect to the first aim, both the Science Undergraduate Society and McGill University pride themselves on preserving student self-governance. As a result, students should have direct input in the creation of events and policies. Consequently, we believe it is important to uphold a tradition of a wide variety of student participation to continue allowing students to voice their opinions and enjoy the best possible university experience.</p>
                                    <p>In respect to the second aim, the SUS provides countless events, activities, and services to enrich the lives of students. Spanning the gamut from Frosh and Science Games to Social Sustainability Week and Academia Week, the SUS has earned recognition and respect as an organization that promotes academic excellence within the context of a fun-filled, socially-active community.</p>
                                    <p>Overall, students and learning are at the heart of all of SUS’s activities and goals. As the second-largest faculty association in one of the world’s most prestigious institutions, the Science Undergraduate Society is committed to inspiring learning, leadership and citizenship. This clarity of purpose generates the strength, desire, and dedication to achieve our aims and fulfill our mandate.</p>
